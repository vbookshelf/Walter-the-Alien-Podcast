Hello, Earth. My name is Walter. I’m an anthropologist from Mars. A quiet observer of your world for the past three years. I walk your streets, listen to your voices, and watch the rhythm of your lives — not to interfere, but to understand. This podcast is my space to reflect. To share out loud what I see and feel.

## Project Overview

Generative AI is opening up new ways to create by separating imagination from technical skill.

Many people have strong creative instincts but haven’t had the chance to develop the skills (e.g. drawing or writing) to express their creativity. AI can help bridge that gap by making it easier to bring ideas to life without years of technical training.

Walter the Alien is a storytelling experiment in human-AI collaboration. I define the story arc. AI generates narrative components. I then edit and shape those outputs into podcast episodes. It's a practical exploration of how AI can support the human creative process.

This is also a chance for me to do something creative that doesn't involve coding.

## AI Tools
- ChatGPT to generate the story ideas and drafts
- Google Generate Speech<br>
Used to convert the text to audio.<br>

- Google NotebookLM Audio Overview<br>
  Used to generate a third party perspective on the content. I also use it to check that the podcast episodes complement each other without creating conflicts and inconsistencies in the overall narrative.<br>

## Lessons Learned - Rough Notes as the project progresses
1- Model Version Anxiety: The style and tone of the generated text are heavily dependant on the model version. If you somehow lose access to your version of a model, say the model gets updated to a new version by the API provider, then the style of the prose you are generating can change dramatically. This can ruin a long term creative project. To reduce this risk it's better to use an open source model that you run locally or run using a cloud GPU rental service.
