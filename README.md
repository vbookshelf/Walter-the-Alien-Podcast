# Walter-the-Alien-Podcast
Hello, Earth. My name is Walter. I’m an anthropologist from Mars. A quiet observer of your world for the past three years. I walk your streets, listen to your voices, and watch the rhythm of your lives — not to interfere, but to understand. This podcast is my space to reflect. To share out loud what I see and feel.
