# Walter the Alien Podcast
### An experiment in Human + AI creative collaboration

Human Life from an Alien Perspective is a YouTube podcast that explores Earth through the curious eyes of Walter — a Martian anthropologist. In each episode, Walter offers thoughtful, sometimes humorous insights into human behavior, culture, and daily life. With an outsider’s clarity and a researcher’s rigor, he unpacks everything from food and fashion to rituals, subcultures, and social norms. It’s a fresh, reflective look at what it means to be human — from someone who isn’t.

Hello, Earth. My name is Walter. I’m an anthropologist from Mars. A quiet observer of your world for the past three years. I walk your streets, listen to your voices, and watch the rhythm of your lives — not to interfere, but to understand. This podcast is my space to reflect. To share out loud what I see and feel.

## Project Overview

Generative AI is opening up new ways to create by separating imagination from technical skill.

Many people have strong creative instincts but haven’t had the chance to develop the skills (e.g. drawing or writing) to express their creativity. AI can help bridge that gap by making it easier to bring ideas to life without years of technical training.

Walter the Alien is a storytelling experiment in human-AI collaboration. I define the story arc. AI generates narrative components. I edit and shape those outputs into podcast scripts. Then I use "Google Generate Speech" to convert the scripts in podcast episodes. 

I only use free tools.

This project is a practical exploration of how AI can support the human creative process.

## Lessons Learned - Rough Notes as the project progresses
1- Model Version Anxiety: The style and tone of the generated text are heavily dependant on the model version. If you somehow lose access to your version of a model, say the model gets updated to a new version by the API provider, then the style of the prose you are generating can change dramatically. This can ruin a long term creative project. To reduce this risk it's better to use an open source model that you run locally or run using a cloud GPU rental service.
